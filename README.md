# minecraft-cci-examples

This repo is to hold a number of different examples for the Minecraft Mode [Content Creator Integration](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/content-creator-integration) including the current config used on my [Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/thetuxcapacitor) for my Modded series. 

Offical Documentation for the Mod can be found [here](https://content-creator-integration.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) but its lacking examples of how to setup the different json config files, hense this repo.

If you find these example useful please do consider checking out my twitch!
