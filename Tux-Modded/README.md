Currently used config files for my Modded Minecraft Series.

These files should be placed in 

config/contentcreatorintegration/default/ 

Of your modded install (after installing the cci mod and running minecraft up once.)

config/contentcreatorintegration/contentcreatorintegration.toml

Should also be modifed to include your twitch channel and streamlabs API key.

NOTE that in chat.json the variableResult value is left empty. This should be the custom-reward-id for the channel reward you have setup to trigger that event.
